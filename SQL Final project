## My final SQL project using all the skills I've learned over the durtation of my bootcamp.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 
SELECT CustomerId,
     CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName, country
  FROM customers
  Where country <> 'USA'

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.
Select customerid,  CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName,country
From customers 
Where country = 'Brazil'

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT invoiceid, invoicedate, billingcountry, CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName
FROM invoices
JOIN customers ON invoices.CustomerId = customers.CustomerId
WHERE billingcountry = 'Brazil'

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM Employees
WHERE title like '%agent'

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT billingcountry 
FROM invoices

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.invoiceid
FROM employees emp
JOIN customers cust ON cust.supportrepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices inv ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.firstname,emp.lastname, cust.country, total
FROM Employees emp
JOIN customers cust ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid
Join invoices inv ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT (*)
FROM invoices 
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

#9.What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT Total(total)
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT tracks.Name,invoicelineID
FROM invoice_items inv
JOIN tracks ON tracks.TrackId = inv.InvoiceId

#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name as Artist,tr.name as trackname, inv.invoicelineid
FROM invoice_items inv
LEFT JOIN tracks tr ON tr.TrackID = inv.TrackID
JOIN Albums a ON a.albumid= tr.albumid 
LEFT Join artists ar ON ar.artistid = a.artistid

#12. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT tr.name as Track, al.title as Album , m.name as Media,g.name as Genre
FROM Tracks tr
JOIN albums al ON al.albumid = tr.albumid 
JOIN media_types m ON m.mediatypeid = tr.mediatypeid
JOIN genres g ON g.genreid = tr.genreid

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, SUM(i.total) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers cus on cus.supportrepid = e.employeeid
JOIN invoices i ON i.customerid = cus.customerid 
GROUP BY e.firstname, e.lastname

#14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.firstname, e.lastname, SUM(i.total) as 'Total Sales'
FROM employees e
JOIN customers cus ON cus.supportrepid= e.employeeid
JOIN invoices i ON i.customerid = cus.customerid
WHERE i.invoicedate LIKE '2009%'
GROUP BY e.firstname 
ORDER BY 'Total Sales' desc limit 1
