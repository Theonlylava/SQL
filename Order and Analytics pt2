#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

SELECT COUNT(orderID) FROM Jansales
WHERE length(orderid) =6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid) FROM Jansales 
WHERE product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct acctnum FROM customers
JOIN Febsales ON Customers.order_id= Febsales.orderid 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM JanSales
Order by price asc limit 1 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Sum(quantity)*(price) as revenue, product
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product

#Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Sum(quantity),product, Sum(quantity)*price as revenue

 WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
 Group by product


#How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT (distinct acctnum),avg(quantity*price) 
FROM FebSales
Left join customers on Febsales.orderID= customers.order_id
